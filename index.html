              Started by web developement journey in 2018, when i was just
              introduced to the superb world of programming, from then the
              journey has been inevitable. Completed by Bachleors in Information
              technology in 2022 , i have gained a lot of expereince in this
              journey by doing some really fun projects and getting mentored by
              some really gret web dev tutors through their mentorhsip

              projects and share my knowledge ahead.
